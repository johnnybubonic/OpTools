The following functions are available within the SigSession() class:

getTpls()
Get the user-specified templates if they exist, otherwise set up stock ones.

modifyDirmngr(op)
*op* can be either:
new/start/replace - modify dirmngr to use the runtime-specified keyserver(s)
old/stop/restore - modify dirmngr back to the keyservers that were defined before modification

buildKeys()
build out the keys dict (see REF.keys.struct.txt).

getKeys()
fetch keys in the keys dict (see REF.keys.struct.txt) from a keyserver if they aren't found in the local keyring.

trustKeys()
set up trusts for the keys in the keys dict (see REF.keys.struct.txt). prompts for each trust not found/specified at runtime.

sigKeys()
sign keys in the keys dict (see REF.keys.struct.txt), either exportable or local depending on runtime specification.

pushKeys()
push keys in the keys dict (see REF.keys.struct.txt) to the keyservers specified at runtime (as long as they weren't specified to be local/non-exportable signatures; then we don't bother).

sendMails()
send emails to each of the recipients specified in the keys dict (see REF.keys.struct.txt).

serverParser(uri)
returns a dict of a keyserver URI broken up into separate components easier for parsing.

verifyArgs(locargs)
does some verifications, classifies certain data, calls serverParser(), etc.
